    <p>Writing about yourself is a bit awkward, the hardest part is how to start talking about yourself but I'll give it shot. Professionally, my career in coding is only beginning but even with this small beginning I am incredibly excited about this field. 
    I graduated with honors from University of North Texas, my Bachelor of Science degree is in Integrative Studies with focuses in Biology, Public Service, and Economics. 
    <br><br>
    My primary goal is to continue learning all that I can about coding, as this field has no shortages of new things to learn. One of the most impressive parts about coding is that it can be applied to almost any field of study, and my plan is to use it to 
    pursue a career in bioinformatics.
