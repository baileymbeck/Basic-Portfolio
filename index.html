        <p>Writing about yourself is a bit awkward, the hardest part is figuring out how to start talking about yourself - but I'll give it shot. Professionally, my career in coding is only
        beginning but even with this small beginning I am incredibly excited about this field. I graduated with honors from University of North Texas, my Bachelor of Science degree is in 
        Integrative Studies with focuses in Biology, Public Service, and Economics.  
         <br><br>
        My primary goal is to continue learning all that I can about coding, as this field is so vast and has no shortages of new things to learn. My plan is to use it to pursue a career in 
        bioinformatics.
